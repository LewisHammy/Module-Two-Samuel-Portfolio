## Conclusion 

<strong>This project is a website that serves as a simple yet professional portfolio. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. The website is fully functional, with all links and hover elements working, and is accessible on all platforms. The mobile version of the website features a slide navigation bar. However, some features are not yet functional, including the resume button. Also tge applications do not go to working sites (the apps were not made by me, I have yet to make my own project as my portfolio is technically  my first one), and a contact form that allows users to type in information but does not send to me.</strong>
